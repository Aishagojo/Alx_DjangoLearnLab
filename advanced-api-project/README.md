# Advanced API Project - Book Management

This project is built with Django REST Framework and demonstrates custom and generic views with permissions for CRUD operations.

## Authentication
- Use Djangoâ€™s superuser or any authenticated user to test POST, PUT, DELETE.

- Author and Book have a one-to-many relationship; each book belongs to one author.
